Use the directional pad to navigate the menu

Press A on the xbox controller to select an option

Press A on the back symbol to leave a menu

In the options menu use the scroll bar with the directional pad to control the main menu music

Quit Game ends the session, Start game starts the game

Press the start button on the xbox controller while in the game to access the pause menu

Mouse controls can be substituted for xbox controls as well

__________________________________________

Everything above works, if not it may take a second push of the button, there are some button pushing delays

The Control schemes do not work yet because we have not made our game yet

There is no player selection :/

The sounds scroll bar does not control anything because there are no sounds yet

The pause menu options do not change anything because there are no in game sounds yet

The leaderboards and credits are not interactable purposely

___________________________________________

This milestone was made with mostly blueprints because when doing an earlier project I noticed it was much easier to do with blueprints, 
I hope this does not affect my mark

I also hope what I zipped was right, if not please let me know quickly so I can resubmit it

Merry Christmas!
